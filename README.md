Exoplanet Detection Website
Team  name:Looptroop

Team Lead: Sneha Biju
Team Member: Mohil C

Project Overview
This website leverages machine learning to detect exoplanets by analyzing star brightness data (light curves). It cleans raw data, extracts key features using advanced time series techniques, and classifies potential planet transits using a gradient boosted tree model. The site offers an efficient, accurate, and user-friendly platform for exploring exoplanet candidates automatically, reducing manual vetting workload for astronomers.

How It Works
Data Input: Users submit or upload light curve data.

Feature Extraction: The system extracts meaningful features from the star brightness over time.

Classification: The trained machine learning model predicts whether the input data contains exoplanet transits.

Results Display: The website presents predictions along with confidence scores and relevant visualizations.

Benefits
Fast and computationally efficient.

High accuracy with fewer false positives.

Supports data from multiple space missions (Kepler, TESS).

Easy-to-use interface for both scientists and enthusiasts.

Tech Stack and Tools
Python (backend processing and ML model)

tsfresh (time series feature extraction)

LightGBM (gradient boosting classifier)

Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript for frontend)

Public NASA datasets (Kepler, K2, TESS)
